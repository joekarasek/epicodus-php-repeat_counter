# _Repeat Counter, Week 2 Code Review_

#### _Code review for second week of level 2 PHP, 2.19.2016_

### By _**Joseph Karasek**_

## Description

_This web app is designed to take an input phrase, as well as a word to search for, and will return the number of instances of the given word within the phrase._

_The goal of this code review is to show basic understanding and competency with php and the Silex micro-framework, BDD using PHPUnit, and use of the Twig templating engine._

_The following criteria will be considered in review of this code._
* Did you include a README with a description of the program, setup instructions, a copyright, a license, and your name?
* Is the project tracked in Git, and did you regularly make commits with clear messages that finish the phrase "This commit willâ€¦"?
* Did you submit your English specs as a separate text file? Was it committed before you began your code?
* Did you complete your method by making your tests pass before starting on the Silex app?
* Do your specs start with the simplest case and progress to more complex cases? Do they cover enough different input values?
* Have all specs been written up correctly as test methods?
* Are all tests passing? Does your method correctly return the number of repeats?
* Is the RepeatCounter class being instantiated correctly? Is its countRepeats method being called correctly, passing it user input from a form?
* Were Twig template files used for all pages?
* Is your logic easy to understand?
* Did you use descriptive variable names?
* Does your code have proper indentation and spacing?
